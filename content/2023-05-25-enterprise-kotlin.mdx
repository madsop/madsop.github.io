If you look at the documentation on the Kotlin web page (<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/server-overview.html">
Kotlin for server side</a>), you’ll find a list of available
frameworks for running Kotlin server-side, a list currently consisting of Spring, Vert.x, Ktor, kotlinx.html, Micronaut,
http4k and Javalin.

None of these support <a href="https://jakarta.ee">Jakarta EE</a>, although for instance Spring is based on several
Jakarta EE specifications, but it’s
far from a full implementation.

This raises two questions to me: 1. can you use Jakarta EE and Kotlin in combination, and 2. should you?

The Kotlin docs state that “Kotlin is a great fit for developing server-side applications. It allows you to write
concise and expressive code while maintaining full compatibility with existing Java-based technology
stacks” (<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/server-overview.html">
Kotlin for server side</a>), so the answer to whether it’s possible clearly is yes. That’s with a technocratic
perspective to the concept of <em>possible</em>, so the question should be rephrased into is it possible <em>within
sensible time, space and hassle?</em>

We’ll answer that by starting to walk the path there and see what happens. The first step down that road is picking a
runtime that supports Jakarta EE, and getting that one up and running.

That gives us quite some options, including RedHat WildFly, Payara Server, Apache TomEE and Eclipse GlassFish. Let’s
choose OpenLiberty from IBM for now, as that’s a runtime currently supporting the newest Jakarta EE, 10.

When getting started with OpenLiberty, the obvious place to start is at the Get started section of the OpenLiberty web
page. From here, we can download the necessary build and configuration files that give us a starting point, be it with
Maven or Gradle.

Once we’ve got OpenLiberty started up and running, it’ll be running Java code. Nice, but we’re interested in Kotlin, so
the next step is to transition over to running Kotlin code. Changing the code is fast, you can even use IntelliJ to
automatically convert the demo code into Kotlin. However, we’ll also need a dependency to the Kotlin compiler, so that
you can use the Kotlin language, and your code can actually compile:

```
<code>
    <dependency>  
        <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId> 
        <artifactId>kotlin-stdlib</artifactId>
        <version>${kotlin.version}</version>  
    </dependency>
    </code>
```
In addition, you’ll need the <em>kotlin-maven-plugin</em> for your build to be able to parse the Kotlin classes. Towards
the end
of this article, you’ll find the complete config required to run your Jakarta EE application.

That’ll make your code compile, which certainly is a good start, but you will inevitably run into issues when starting
your application.

Why is that? In Kotlin, all classes and methods are by default final. Thus, they cannot be extended or overridden by
subclasses, or by any kind of proxy. In the CDI specification, though, it’s explicitly stated that beans must be
eligible for overriding. As CDI is in the core of Jakarta EE, and used by many of the other specifications as well, this
clearly has the potential of being a dealbreaker.

However, there are two solutions to this problem:

1. <em>open</em> is a keyword in Kotlin, making the annotated class or method non-final. This solution is problematic if
   you’re
   using constructor injection though, as the generated get methods will be final.

2. The <em>all-open</em> plugin which you can include in your pom.xml or build.gradle. This plugin will ensure that all
   classes
   annotated with one of the annotations you specify will be made non-final. You can then make for instance all
   @ApplicationScoped or @RequestScoped beans non-final, while sticking to the default Kotlin behaviour for your other
   classes. Note that you’ll have to specify the full namespace of the annotations, so make sure to use the Jakarta
   namespace if you’re on Jakarta EE 9 or newer, or javax if you’re still on Jakarta EE 8.

The next issue you’ll run into is that you’ll have to create no-args constructors for your beans as well. You can of
course do that by hand, but it quickly becomes cumbersome. You’ll also end up with lots of wiring code that CDI should
be taking care of without your intervention. The same goes when using Jakarta Persistence, which requires entities to
have a no-args constructor. Luckily, there’s a compiler plugin at your service also for these issues — the <em>
no-arg</em>
plugin. If you’re using JPA, there’s a specialized version of it you should use instead — simply named jpa.

With these problems solved, you will now be able to run Jakarta EE for your Kotlin code.
On <a href="https://github.com/madsop/enterprise-kotlin">my GitHub</a>, you can find a
code example and see how I’ve done it, where you through the commits can follow along.

However, if you run into some issues, the existing documentation is scarce. Here are the (few!) relevant blog posts and
articles I’ve found useful while doing my research:

<a href="https://github.com/gcharters/Kotlin-REST-Service">GitHub — gcharters/Kotlin-REST-Service: How to write a simple
Kotlin REST service on Open Liberty</a>

<a href="https://rieckpil.de/howto-write-java-ee-applications-with-kotlin/">Guide to writing Java EE applications with
Kotlin — rieckpil</a>

<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin/java-ee-kotlin-app">Java EE Application with Kotlin | Baeldung on Kotlin</a>

Note that several of these links talk about <em>Java EE</em>, even though they are published as recently as this year,
while Java
EE became Jakarta EE in 2019.

Now you’re ready to unleash the productivity boost from combining Jakarta EE with Kotlin. Enjoy, and happy coding!

As promised earlier on, here’s the full config you will need:
