This summer, <a href="../1-z0-1113-the-oracle-certification-no-one-cares-about/">I wrote about the 1Z0-1113 certification</a>.

I promised to update on this blog if I were to give the exam a shot. This is that update. I've signed up for the exam, and in a couple of weeks, I have my exam.

Since then, I've attempted what is out there on Udemy exams. Sometimes they are useful, but at other times, the questions are confusing or straight up wrong. Lots of questions with several correct answers, and you just have to guess what the answer they want is.

And, if you were wondering whether the state of information about the exam is better now than it was in July? No, it's not, the state is pretty much the same.

So now I've switched my focus over to <a href="https://helidon.io/docs/v2/about/01_overview">the official documentation</a>. It's somewhat verbose here and there, but many parts are quite concise as well - and after all, it's reliable. I can trust what I read there.

A red flag about the exam is that it is "validated for Helidon 2.5.X", as it states on <a href="https://education.oracle.com/helidon-microservices-developer/pexam_1Z0-1113">the official web site</a>. The newest Helidon version is 4, which is based on an entirely new web server, NÃ­ma, built thoroughly with virtual threads. This illustrates that a lot of things have changed since the Helidon version the exam tests you on, and I wouldn't spend my time on this certification if I were to learn Helidon today.

But Mads, why are you here then, stating that you've signed up for the exam? There are several reasons:
* After spending so much time researching this exam, I'm curious to see what it's actually like.
* As an <a href="https://ace.oracle.com/">Oracle ACE</a>, I get a free exam attempt per year, so it doesn't cost me any money to give it a try.
* I know a lot of the topics the exam is about, such as MicroProfile and microservice architecture, so I should have a decent chance at passing.
* Someone should write something on the internet what the certification really is like. That might as well be me.

That's all for today, I'll be back with an update in a couple of weeks with a post-exam update.
